Ceylon Café - Front-End Coffee Shop Website
this project is a fully responsive front-end website for a fictional coffee shop named Ceylon Café. The site includes sections like Home, About Us, Menu, Products, Blog, and Contact, designed to offer an engaging and user-friendly experience. It showcases the café’s offerings, unique atmosphere, and customer-focused branding using modern web design practices.
 developed a fully responsive front-end website for a fictional coffee shop, Ceylon Café, using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, and Font Awesome. During development, I faced challenges such as broken file paths, navbar issues on smaller screens, layout misalignment, and missing icons—all of which I resolved through debugging, using Bootstrap utilities, and updating resource links. This project strengthened my front-end development skills, especially in responsive design and real-world problem-solving.
The result is a clean, visually appealing, and fully responsive coffee shop website that can serve as a solid front-end base for future e-commerce functionality. This project strengthened my skills in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, responsive design, and practical debugging.
